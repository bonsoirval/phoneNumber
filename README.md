# phoneNumber
This is a simple python script to read .csv or .txt file containing phone numbers.
It will remove commas, white spaces and align the numbers one in each line and save in a file called todayman.txt
INSPIRATION:
I was inspired to write this scripts when a bulksms client's phone numbers were in csv in lines.
Enjoy as you as you wish.
